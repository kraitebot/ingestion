# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.4.8 - 2026-04-23

### Features

- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/CalculateWapExchangeClassLoadingTest.php` — 6-case suite pinning the `final`-class fix on `CalculateWapAndModifyProfitOrderJob`: base not declared final, Binance + Bitget exchange variants load without FatalError, JobProxy resolves per-exchange correctly, unmapped exchanges fall back to base.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/CancelOrphanAlgoOrdersWiringTest.php` — pins `JobProxy` resolution of `CancelOrphanAlgoOrdersJob` (Binance variant for Binance accounts, base no-op for bitget/bybit/kucoin) and verifies the step-1 placement inside `SmartReplaceOrdersJob::compute()` (orphan-scrub before recreation).
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/OrderObserverDriftDetectionDuringSyncTest.php` — 5 cases locking the drift-detection contract during `syncing`: price/qty drifts dispatched mid-sync, `opening`/`waping` still correctly skipped, plain `active` baseline still works.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/RecreateCancelledOrderClosePositionAlgoTest.php` — 3 cases for the closePosition-style algo exemption in `RecreateCancelledOrderJob::startOrFail()`: `is_algo + reference_quantity=0` allowed, non-algo zero-qty still rejected, regular LIMIT with positive qty still allowed.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Unit/Support/ApiExceptionHelpersChainWalkTest.php` — 7 cases for the `getPrevious()` chain-walk in `containsHttpExceptionIn`: raw + wrapped Binance `-5027` both classified as ignorable, 3-level-deep wraps still walk, wrapped non-ignorable codes correctly rejected, wrapped 503 + `-1021` route to retry classifier.

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] `routes/console.php` — `kraite:cron-sync-orders` re-enabled on the scheduler (every minute, `withoutOverlapping`). `kraite:purge-model-logs --duration=30` wired on the scheduler daily at 03:30 for the new model_logs retention policy.
- [IMPROVED] `tests/Feature/WapWorkflow/OrderObserverDriftSkipTest.php` — flipped the `syncing` test case to reflect the new contract (drift detection NOW fires during syncing; previously pinned the buggy skip behaviour). Docblock updated with the rationale for why `syncing` must NOT be in the skip list.
- [IMPROVED] `.env` — `NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true` enabling the unified notification pipeline for production operation.

## 1.4.7 - 2026-04-23

### Features

- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Unit/Support/MathIsPositiveTest.php` — 7-case suite pinning `Math::isPositive()` across null, non-numeric types, empty/sign-only strings, malformed numerics, zero in every supported form, negatives, and strictly-positive values (including scientific notation, comma decimals, and leading `+`).
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Unit/Support/ApiDataMappers/Binance/BinanceAccountQueryTradesTest.php` — 3 tests locking the Binance `/fapi/v1/userTrades` query limit at 5 (orderId present/absent both carry the limit).
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Unit/Jobs/Atomic/Order/SyncPositionOrdersAllFailedMessageTest.php` — asserts the "all failed" `RuntimeException` reports the failure count (not a raw `exchange_order_id`). Buggy interpolation would emit `"All 9876543+ orders failed..."`; the test explicitly refuses that shape.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Unit/Jobs/Atomic/Position/ExtractClosingPriceFromTradesTest.php` — 8-test suite for the new reducing-trade extractor: signature accepts `string $direction`, empty trades returns null, LONG picks SELL, SHORT picks BUY, newest-first short-circuit, positionSide-absent fallback, case-insensitive direction, zero-price trades ignored.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/ModelLogCurrentStepLifecycleTest.php` — 5 tests covering the process-scoped step context: set during `handle()`, cleared by `__destruct` after sync success / exception / `stopJob()` exits, identity-guard prevents cross-job stomp, and `Queue::after` listener clears on real queued-job completion.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/OrderObserverFilledAtGuardTest.php` — 3 tests pinning `filled_at` behaviour: stamped on first NEW → FILLED, NOT re-bumped on subsequent FILLED saves, never set on non-FILLED saves.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/ResolveSyncedPriceTest.php` — 7 tests for the cancelled-algo-price preservation: null / empty / integer-0 / string-"0" / multi-decimal-"0.00000000" all preserve the stored DB price; legitimate non-zero values flow through.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/PreparePositionsOpeningJobNoChildBlockTest.php` — end-to-end guard that `DispatchPositionSlotsJob` is persisted without a `child_block_uuid`. Prevents the block-completion wedge that used to hold `PreparePositionsOpeningJob` in `Running` forever.

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] `routes/console.php` — commented out the test-ambient cron entries (`kraite:cron-sync-orders`, `kraite:cron-fetch-klines --*`, `kraite:cron-store-accounts-balances`, `kraite:purge-candles`) so only the step-dispatcher family (`steps:dispatch`, `steps:recover-stale`, `steps:archive`) runs during the isolated sync-orders test suite. Re-enable before shipping.

## 1.4.6 - 2026-04-22

### Features

- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/Jobs/DispatchPerSymbolKlineBlocksJobTest.php` — 2-test suite pinning the new per-symbol orchestrator: one block per symbol with correct (klines@idx1 + correlation/elasticity@idx2) layout, and zero blocks when symbolIds list is empty.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/Jobs/CalculateBtcCorrelationJobTest.php` — 4-test suite validating the correlation optimizations: perfect positive correlation → pearson > 0.99, perfect negative → pearson < -0.99, same symbol fed different klines yields different persisted correlation values, and BTC candle cache is reused across symbols.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/Commands/FetchKlinesCommandPerSymbolBlockTest.php` — 3-test suite for the command's two-phase block layout: shared BTC block has `DispatchPerSymbolKlineBlocksJob` at index 2, per-symbol correlation steps aren't created upfront (lazy spawn), and the orchestrator materializes one block per symbol when executed.

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] `config/horizon.php` — reallocated worker counts per queue based on observed saturation: `indicators` 20→30 (biggest bottleneck, mixed API-gated + CPU-bound work), `positions` 5→8 (trading latency is user-facing), `cronjobs` 20→8 (orchestrators are lightweight, 20 was over-provisioned), `orders` 10→5 (low volume, only `PlaceLimitOrderJob` lands here). `priority` stays 5. Applied across `local`, `ingestion`, `worker1`, `worker2` environments. Net: 61 → 57 workers.

## 1.4.5 - 2026-04-22

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] `routes/console.php` — swapped the now-deleted `kraite:cron-check-stale-data` schedule for `steps:recover-stale --recover-dispatched --release-locks`. Stall detection (Running zombies, stuck Dispatched steps, wedged dispatcher locks) moved into `brunocfalcao/step-dispatcher` v1.11; pushover/email alerts remain via `kraitebot/core`'s `SendStaleStepsNotification` listener. Same cadence, same notifications.
- [IMPROVED] `config/horizon.php` — multi-queue supervisor lineup across `local`, `ingestion`, `worker1`, `worker2` environments. Removed `default-supervisor` + `step-dispatcher-supervisor`. Added domain supervisors: `positions-supervisor` (5w), `orders-supervisor` (10w), `cronjobs-supervisor` (20w), `indicators-supervisor` (20w). Kept `priority-supervisor` (5w) for the `priority='high'` bypass lane and hostname/ingestion/worker-N supervisors. Anything that slips to the bare `default` queue now stalls with zero workers — intentional audit signal for unmapped step creations.
- [IMPROVED] `.env` — flipped `STEP_DISPATCHER_LOGGING_ENABLED` to `false` so production stops accumulating per-step log folders.

## 1.4.4 - 2026-04-21

### Features

- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/WapWorkflow/` — 22-test suite pinning the WAP workflow hardening landed earlier today: `UpdatePositionStatusGuardTest`, `PositionProfitOrderFilterTest`, `OrderObserverDriftSkipTest`, `CalculateWapFollowUpAckTest`.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Unit/StepDispatcher/T19_GroupFanoutTest` — 5 tests exercising the new fan-out threshold in the step-dispatcher package.

### Fixes

- [BUG FIX] `AppLogTest > it stores metadata as JSON` — canonicalize both sides with `ksort` before asserting equality; MySQL JSON columns don't preserve key order on retrieval, and the test had been failing silently as a baseline.
- [BUG FIX] `DiscoverCMCTokenForExchangeSymbolJobTest > skips if exchange symbol already has symbol_id` — call `startOrSkip()` instead of the removed `startOrFail()`; the job's guard was renamed in `kraitebot/core` v1.3.6 but the test was never updated.

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] Bump `brunocfalcao/step-dispatcher` to v1.9.0 to pick up the group fan-out guard — hourly batch crons (kline fetch, BTC correlation / elasticity, indicator queries) no longer pile 600–1,100 siblings onto a single group.
- [IMPROVED] Drop orphan `composer-patches` `patches` entry from `composer.json`; the referenced `patches/laravel-boost-https-fix.patch` file was deleted in `f191a80` but the config still referenced it, breaking `composer update` with a missing-file error.

## 1.4.3 - 2026-04-21

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] Schedule `kraite:cron-sync-orders` every minute (withoutOverlapping, outside cooldown gate) so open positions reconcile order state from the exchange on a tight cadence.
- [IMPROVED] Drop `default-supervisor` process count 50 → 20 to match actual throughput needs; the 50-worker bump was exploratory during load testing and held ~2 GB more RAM than needed.

## 1.4.2 - 2026-04-20

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] Horizon `default-supervisor` bumped 5 → 30 (crypto step jobs dispatch to `default` queue, not `step-dispatcher`) and `balance: 'simple'` added to all local supervisors so workers stay spawned rather than scaling down during queue lulls.
- [IMPROVED] Removed obsolete 6h and 1d kline fetch schedules — timeframes trimmed to `[1h, 4h, 12h]` in the exchange config, so those schedules had no consumers.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-04-20

### Fixes

- [BUG FIX] Schedule `steps:recover-stale` every minute so orphaned Running steps get reclaimed automatically after worker crashes (command existed in the step-dispatcher package but was never wired to the scheduler)
