# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.4.5 - 2026-04-22

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] `routes/console.php` — swapped the now-deleted `kraite:cron-check-stale-data` schedule for `steps:recover-stale --recover-dispatched --release-locks`. Stall detection (Running zombies, stuck Dispatched steps, wedged dispatcher locks) moved into `brunocfalcao/step-dispatcher` v1.11; pushover/email alerts remain via `kraitebot/core`'s `SendStaleStepsNotification` listener. Same cadence, same notifications.
- [IMPROVED] `config/horizon.php` — multi-queue supervisor lineup across `local`, `ingestion`, `worker1`, `worker2` environments. Removed `default-supervisor` + `step-dispatcher-supervisor`. Added domain supervisors: `positions-supervisor` (5w), `orders-supervisor` (10w), `cronjobs-supervisor` (20w), `indicators-supervisor` (20w). Kept `priority-supervisor` (5w) for the `priority='high'` bypass lane and hostname/ingestion/worker-N supervisors. Anything that slips to the bare `default` queue now stalls with zero workers — intentional audit signal for unmapped step creations.
- [IMPROVED] `.env` — flipped `STEP_DISPATCHER_LOGGING_ENABLED` to `false` so production stops accumulating per-step log folders.

## 1.4.4 - 2026-04-21

### Features

- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Feature/WapWorkflow/` — 22-test suite pinning the WAP workflow hardening landed earlier today: `UpdatePositionStatusGuardTest`, `PositionProfitOrderFilterTest`, `OrderObserverDriftSkipTest`, `CalculateWapFollowUpAckTest`.
- [NEW FEATURE] `tests/Unit/StepDispatcher/T19_GroupFanoutTest` — 5 tests exercising the new fan-out threshold in the step-dispatcher package.

### Fixes

- [BUG FIX] `AppLogTest > it stores metadata as JSON` — canonicalize both sides with `ksort` before asserting equality; MySQL JSON columns don't preserve key order on retrieval, and the test had been failing silently as a baseline.
- [BUG FIX] `DiscoverCMCTokenForExchangeSymbolJobTest > skips if exchange symbol already has symbol_id` — call `startOrSkip()` instead of the removed `startOrFail()`; the job's guard was renamed in `kraitebot/core` v1.3.6 but the test was never updated.

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] Bump `brunocfalcao/step-dispatcher` to v1.9.0 to pick up the group fan-out guard — hourly batch crons (kline fetch, BTC correlation / elasticity, indicator queries) no longer pile 600–1,100 siblings onto a single group.
- [IMPROVED] Drop orphan `composer-patches` `patches` entry from `composer.json`; the referenced `patches/laravel-boost-https-fix.patch` file was deleted in `f191a80` but the config still referenced it, breaking `composer update` with a missing-file error.

## 1.4.3 - 2026-04-21

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] Schedule `kraite:cron-sync-orders` every minute (withoutOverlapping, outside cooldown gate) so open positions reconcile order state from the exchange on a tight cadence.
- [IMPROVED] Drop `default-supervisor` process count 50 → 20 to match actual throughput needs; the 50-worker bump was exploratory during load testing and held ~2 GB more RAM than needed.

## 1.4.2 - 2026-04-20

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] Horizon `default-supervisor` bumped 5 → 30 (crypto step jobs dispatch to `default` queue, not `step-dispatcher`) and `balance: 'simple'` added to all local supervisors so workers stay spawned rather than scaling down during queue lulls.
- [IMPROVED] Removed obsolete 6h and 1d kline fetch schedules — timeframes trimmed to `[1h, 4h, 12h]` in the exchange config, so those schedules had no consumers.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-04-20

### Fixes

- [BUG FIX] Schedule `steps:recover-stale` every minute so orphaned Running steps get reclaimed automatically after worker crashes (command existed in the step-dispatcher package but was never wired to the scheduler)
