# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.4.2 - 2026-04-20

### Improvements

- [IMPROVED] Horizon `default-supervisor` bumped 5 → 30 (crypto step jobs dispatch to `default` queue, not `step-dispatcher`) and `balance: 'simple'` added to all local supervisors so workers stay spawned rather than scaling down during queue lulls.
- [IMPROVED] Removed obsolete 6h and 1d kline fetch schedules — timeframes trimmed to `[1h, 4h, 12h]` in the exchange config, so those schedules had no consumers.

## 1.4.1 - 2026-04-20

### Fixes

- [BUG FIX] Schedule `steps:recover-stale` every minute so orphaned Running steps get reclaimed automatically after worker crashes (command existed in the step-dispatcher package but was never wired to the scheduler)

### Improvements
